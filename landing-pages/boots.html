    <h1>PWI + Saf-Gard Boot Discounts</h1>
    <p>PWI has partnered with Saf-Gard Shoes to provide you with an option to purchase your work boots at a discounted price and have it payroll deducted! All shoes will automatically be discounted 10-25%.</p>
    <p>You'll need to know your employee ID which is simply your full 8-digit birthday minus any slashes or hyphens (for example 01/01/2001 becomes 01012001).</p>
